			Hello, I'm <a href="http://localhost:4000" title="To About Me Page" target="_blank"><i>Stephen Agwu,</i></a> a self-taught UX/UI FrontEnd Webdeveloper. I relish the chance to learn new and poingant lessons, not just in software development, but life in general. Feel free to navigate this sites links to learn just a little bit more about me and my work.

			<h1>About Website</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			This website was my first extensive personal project. It was built using jekyll on the back and and hosted by GitHub as my personal page. As such all the code can be seen at this pages <a title="To website github repository" href="https://github.com/osa10928/osa10928.github.io" target="_blank"><i>repository.</i></a><br> I considered building my own site but didn't for one main reason: I wanted this site to be a showcase of my Frontend skills and purely my Frontend skills. This means I wanted to not only remove the need for time consuming Backend implimentations, but that I wanted also to be confined to a certain backend implimentation. Not often does a Frontend developer get to choose how his work is served and by challenging myself to fit within the jekyll environment I hoped to increase my Frontend flexibility. </br> All in all, it was actually pretty fun making and designing this website. Not only was it remenicient of my time spent with Ruby on Rails using Frontend tools like layouts and includes, it also had site and page variables reminicient of RoR variables in helper and control classes. This made work with jekyll highly productive and conducive to proving high levels of organisation. I would recommend jekyll to other Frontend Developers looking to get started with a page of their own. (But honestly, I can't wait to launch a site myself from beginning to end.)

			<h1>About Portfolio</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			The portfolio portion is where you can examine some of my work, mostly codepens and FreeCodeCamp assignments. This portion of the website was built as a side project from the github page which allowed me to test out that part of Jekyll's functionality. It was also built using React because I saw that React supports using Github Pages and I just couldn't help but test it out. Take a look!

			The blog will be the final piece of the website although at this moment it is incomplete. The blog purely for me and anybody who might find me and my musings intersting (should be plenty). Ever since I can remember I've loved to read and write and I have written a veritable book of poetry. Once I learned most developers build their own blog I couldn't wait to get to this point. I have to say, it feels almost like graduating. Once its complete peruse my work and let me know if I'm actually a good poet or not.

			<h1>FunFacts!!</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			Ok, here's the part you have no doubt been waiting for. Just a couple fun facts about who I am and the greatness that is me (accompanied by a few flaws).
		</p></br>
		<ul>
			<li> 
				First and foremost, I love reading manga. It is something I used to hide but, that stopped some years ago. My favorite right now is One Piece, but I love Boku no Hero Acedamia, Seven Deadly Sins and HunterxHunter as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				I went to the University of Texas at Austin where I majored in Biology and American Studies. I also minored in French
			</li>
			<li> 
				If you guessed that I like anime simply because I read manga, well then you're one smart cookie. My favorite anime at the moment is One Punch Man with Boku no Hero Acedamia in a close second.
			</li>
			<li>
				I was president of the humanitarian organization OxfamUT during my college tenure. I was also a part of University Students Against Sweatshops, and was a Human Rights Advisory Counsil liason. Human rights and social justice has and always will hold a special place in my heart.
			</li>
			<li>
				I hate seafood and chinese food. My guess is, right about now you probably feel really strongly about that (most people do). See, I told you I had flaws.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm actually a pretty hard-headed guy. Their isn't much I don't think I can do, and the things I can't do, well, lets just say it took me a long time to admit it that I couldn't do them. The good news is, when you sit down, and really put your mind, body, and internal energies towards a goal, the list of things you can't do remains surprisingly short.
			</li>
		</ul></br>
		<p>
			Ok thats enough about me for now. If you want to hear more about my and my inner thoughts, stay tuned for my blog. Other than that, thanks for dropping by my 'About Me' page. Love and Peace to all!
