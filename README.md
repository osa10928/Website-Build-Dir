# Personal Website
This repo features code for my FrontEnd Personal website. It was created as a method of testing out my FrontEnd developmenet skills and as a way of familizing myself with FrontEnd utilities. The FrontEnd website was built as a Github Page and uses Jekyll to serve the static site. Github serves the page from within the src folder of this repo. The files from the src folder can be found [here](https://github.com/osa10928/osa10928.github.io). 

## Utilities
This site is built using
1. Ruby (ruby 2.4.2)
2. The ruby gem Jekyll (jekyll 3.6.2)
Installing these utilities and updating the gem bundle will allow you to display a static page. The instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/) will describe exactly how to convert this setup into a github page. With this setup one can easily display static pages for the use of building a blog or personal page. My personal websites landing page and about me page utlizes this methodology. But because jekyll only displays static pages and doesn't allow the use of external utlities a bit more set up is necessary to use libraries such as Angular or React. My sites portfolio page uses the React framework. In order for this to work the utilites had to be placed at the root level (as you can see in the repo), and serve a bundle file into the src folder. This enables the portfolio page to function as an Application on a static site. The utilities used during this set up were:
1. Node (node 8.9.3)
2. npm (npm 5.5.1)
3. webpack (3.8.1)
Using these npm as a package manager and webpack as the module bundler I was able to install React and other utlities such as React-Strap (React Bootstrap).

## Website Goals
The goals for this website were two fold:
1. Test and expand my Frontend skills
2. Create a page that could tell potential employers and anyone who is interested a little bit more about me

## Special Thanks
A special thanks to github for serving my site that I have become exeedingly proud of. Thanks to jekyll for providing the gem. Thanks to anyone who has visited my page and enjoyed it. The site was a challenge when I was building it and marks my first solo online project (completed circa 9/1/17), and though it drove me crazy at times, I'm terribly proud of myself for having completed the endeavor. Love and peace all!
