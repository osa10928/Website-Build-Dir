		    Here you can check out a few of my codepens. Most of these pens were assignments from <a href="https://freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and served to introduce me to important Frontend coding concepts such as ajax calls, working in an async environment. These codepens also challenged my knowledge of algorithms and code writing ability (don&apos;t sleep on tictactoe). You can also check out all my codepens <a href="https://codepen.io/osa10928/pens/public/" target="_blank">here</a>.
